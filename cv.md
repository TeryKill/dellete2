<p class="left"> Hi there! My name's TeryKill and I live in Russia. I'm 31 years old.I've got two furry sons who start bothering me to sleep at exactly 4:20am every morning. Even though they drive me crazy sometimes, I still love those cats. Sometimes I even dream of turning them into fur coats! </p>
<p class="left"> Anyway, I also have a computer in my apartment that I use to program.</p>
